C++ Project - A game where AIs try to kill one another

Authors : Sebastien Delanos, Jordan Chazottes

This is a school project. The purpose was to create a game where different teams of AI try to be the last one standing.
The rules are simple :
  - An AI dies if it's surrounded by two enemy AIs of the same team.
  
Three scripts are available to test the project with default settings.
